  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

  <p>By achieving FU money asap I don’t mean hurrying for it. Let it take its time and course. I just want to start working towards it asap.</p>
  <p>Initial goal is to achieve 1 hour per day of work for 1 lakh INR of income.</p>
  <p>If we have such a long and rich history behind us, along with all the technology and now AI, why aren’t we able to able to reach such a small goal (1hr/day for 1LPM) with all of the leverage in the world?</p>
  <blockquote>Seek, and you shall find.</blockquote>
  <p>My friend (rightly) said, if it were this easy, everyone would’ve been doing it.</p>
  <p>But, my rebuttal to it is, only 0.01% of the population might be seeking for FU money, remaining are either trying to survive, or looking/working for a job.</p>
  <p>Ones who are in the pursuit of freedom are extremely rare.</p>
  <h3>Extremes</h3>
  <p>People usually try to directly aim for becoming a millionaire or else stick to a job. Majority doesn’t of think what’s in between.</p>
  <p>There are indie hackers making good $10-30K/month and travelling the around world.</p>
  <h3>Maximising the probability of success</h3>
  <p>I want to be in the middle of normal distribution in terms of maximising the probability of success.</p>
  <h3>I don’t know what I don’t know</h3>
  <p>As the heading suggests, I’m trying to figure out the unknown unknowns as well, I’m in search of it on parallel.</p>

  <h3>Chasing freedom, not money</h3>
  <p>I’m doing all this to free up bandwidth for things I’m absolutely passionate about. Such as music, science and mental health, to name a few.</p>
  <p>We all know for sure, a salaried job isn’t gonna get us wealth.</p>
