    <h2> 02.02.2023 </h2>
    <p> Before leaving Ultrahuman, I was thinking next paradigm shift in my career would come from FU money, but little did I know, the next step was a higher paying job. Around 3x more, which would provide me a money cuision, which will be used in the now next paradigm shift, i.e. FU Money or passive income.
<br>
Talking to Sahu (Abhishek) made me realise that we usually look at money as purchasing power, but we rarely realise that money can buy time too, in the sense getting runway for example for next 5 years. You don't need to be employed thus you can build anything you want without hinderance.
<br>
Few years ago, I used to call up US realtors and sell them Facebook ad services, then actual ads were to be handles by VAs, this business model can be 90% automated.
<br>
Now that I have money, I just need to find one business that I can start with least involvement from side. Will try something in GCC, as they're beind the west in all the tech stuff. For example, starting a LinkedIn agency, making businesspeople thought leaders on LinkedIn.
<br>
Also started watching My First Million podcast by Sam Parr and Shaan Puri, and they have some crazy insights too.
<br>
Next stop: FU Money
